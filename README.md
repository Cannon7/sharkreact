# Overview
This is a website designed for people who are constantly loaning things out and never getting them back. This website is ment to keep track of those items, who you loaned them out to, and for how long. You will never lose track of your items again or when someone claims that they "lost it", you know who to contact.


# Development Environment

We used REACT with some CSS to bring this project to life.
